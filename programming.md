I've been programming since 2017, when I first started coding using [Processing](https://processing.org/).
After that, I moved on to [Java](https://go.java/?intcmp=gojava-banner-java-com), started modding Minecraft with [Forge](http://minecraftforge.net/) in 2018
and finally learned [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) in 2019, which is the programming language I'm currently using the most.
