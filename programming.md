I've been programming since 2017, when I first started coding using <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a>.
After that, I moved on to <a href="https://go.java/?intcmp=gojava-banner-java-com" target="_blank">Java</a>, started modding Minecraft with <a href="http://minecraftforge.net/" target="_blank">Forge</a> in 2018
and finally learned <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/" target="_blank">Kotlin</a> in 2019, which is the programming language I'm currently using the most.
