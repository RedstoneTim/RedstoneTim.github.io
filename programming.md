I've been programming since 2017, when I first started coding using [Processing](https://processing.org/){:target="_blank"}.
After that, I moved on to [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/){:target="_blank"}, started modding Minecraft with [Forge](http://minecraftforge.net/){:target="_blank"} in 2018
and finally learned [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/){:target="_blank"} in 2019, which is the programming language I'm currently using the most.
