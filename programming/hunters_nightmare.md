Hunter's Nightmare (formerly known as [Hunter's Dream](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/huntersdream){:target="_blank"}) is a Minecraft mod that I've been coding in a small team called ([TheBlockBox](https://github.com/TheBlockBox){:target="_blank"}) since Summer 2018.

# Features
Hunter's Nightmare runs on 1.12.2 and a 1.15.2 version is currently in development.  

From the CurseForge description:

> Hunter's Nightmare (formerly Hunter's Dream) Mod is a Minecraft modification which will add supernatural hunting in Minecraft, ranging from folklore monsters to spirits behind the veil. The technology and equipment used will be of modern era style rather than the typical old-fashion medieval equipment. Such as Guns, from Shotguns to Snipers Rifles and Stakes, Bullet Types, Traps involving herbs and other magical means to hunt down your nightmarish monsters. Though be careful, as facing down some may come with a life changing consequence if you're not careful or prepared.

# History
Hunter's Nightmare is the first serious project I coded for. I first found out about it on MinecraftForum, when I thought that I could try to help someone code a "small" mod.  
There, I stumbled upon [this post](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/requests-ideas-for-mods/2906874-modification-idea-supernatural-entities-mod-sem){:target="_blank"} (it's sadly not available anymore) from June 23rd, 2018.  
The idea about supernatural mobs seemed kinda interesting and I thought I'd look a bit more into it, so I joined the discord server (my first reply was asking for a new link, since the given one was dead, lol),
where I met [RebelT](https://github.com/PixelEyeStudios){:target="_blank"} and [TheGamingLord](https://github.com/TheGamingLord){:target="_blank"}.
