Here are some smaller games I created:  

# OpenProcessing sketches
Here are some sketches I created using [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/user/105993/){:target="_blank"}:  
Some of them only work if you're on a computer.  

## Snake
Just basic snake, nothing complicated. The code isn't great though.

## Thonk Snake
The ultimate upgrade, instead of being a snake that gets larger by eating, you become a thonk that evolves by learning!  
A video of an older version can be found [here](https://youtu.be/6-wH3U9e17Y){:target="_blank"}.

## TicTacToe in 50 lines
It's just ... TicTacToe in 50 lines.

## Rock Paper Scissors with AI
This one is a bit fancier. You just play Rock Paper Scissors, but it's against an AI.  
If you want to see me fail against the AI, watch the [video I made about it](https://youtu.be/MRiCQ_9FZhE){:target="_blank"}. I also explained how the AI works in the comments.

## 15 puzzle
A simple implementation of the 15 puzzle (you can get bigger/smaller versions by changing the code) in less than 100 lines of code.  
[SlidySim](https://slidysim.000webhostapp.com/){:target="_blank"} is still much better though.
