A Swamp's Curse is a mod for Minecraft 1.14.4 developed by [TheBlockBox](theblockbox.html) for [Spooky Jam 2019](https://github.com/MinecraftModDevelopment/MMD-Site/blob/master/docs/events/spooky_jam_2019.md){:target="_blank"}.  

It features a [special witch](https://youtu.be/pn4_vcSPZwg){:target="_blank"} that can spawn in swamps and will summon ghouls to attack you.

The mod has a [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/aswampscurse){:target="_blank"} where you can download the newest version and a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheBlockBox/aswampscurse){:target="_blank"}.
All source code (including the assets) is available there and can be used according to the [MIT license](https://github.com/TheBlockBox/aswampscurse/blob/master/LICENSE){:target="_blank"}.

As this mod was badly programmed and we didn't have enough interest to maintain the mod, it is currently not under active development and the repository is archived.
