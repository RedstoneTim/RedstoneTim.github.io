Undercover Witches is my second [attempt](a_swamps_curse.html) at coding a mod for Spooky Jam, this time it was for [Spooky Jam 2020](https://github.com/MinecraftModDevelopment/MMD-Site/blob/master/docs/events/spooky_jam_2020.md){:target="_blank"}.

The mod was made for Minecraft 1.16.3 as required by the jam. It's written entirely in Java and thanks to its simplicity, all the code fits into a single file and the mod only needs to be installed server-side.  
You can find the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/TheBlockBox/UndercoverWitches){:target="_blank"}. I wrote all of the code myself within a few hours and RebelT drew the (in my opinion really cool looking) logo.

To list the features, I'll just quote the [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/undercoverwitches){:target="_blank"}:  

> "Undercover witches" are witches disguised as black cats. They can appear in the world randomly or when a witch is killed and will deliver you special morning gifts.

If you want to know what these mornings gifts actually are, there's no way other than to have a look at it yourself...
