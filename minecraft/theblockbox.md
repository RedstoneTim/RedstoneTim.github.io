TheBlockBox (formerly known as PixelEyeStudios) is a small group of Minecraft modders. The core members are [RebelT](https://github.com/PixelEyeStudios){:target="_blank"}, [DanTGL](https://github.com/DanTGL){:target="_blank"} and me.  
Currently, our main focus is on a mod called [Hunter's Nightmare](hunters_nightmare.html), although we also create smaller projects like [Undercover Witches](undercover_witches.html).

# History
After learning to mod Minecraft 1.12.2 sometime in 2018, I wanted to get some practice by coding a few small projects. So, I searched around on MinecraftForum and found [this post](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/requests-ideas-for-mods/2906874-modification-idea-supernatural-entities-mod-sem){:target="_blank"}
 (it's sadly not available anymore) from June 23rd, 2018.  
The idea of supernatural mobs seemed kinda interesting and I thought I'd look a bit more into it, so I joined the discord server where I met the two.  
So, we started coding Hunter's Dream (now called Hunter's Nightmare), gave ourselves the name "PixelEyeStudios", changed that to "TheBlockBox" later, released the first few versions of the mod and created some smaller ones.
