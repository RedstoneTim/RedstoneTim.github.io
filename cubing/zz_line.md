title: ZZ-Line
---
**ZZ-Line** is a 3x3 method which I proposed in February 2020 in a [post on the SpeedSolving Forums](https://www.speedsolving.com/threads/the-new-method-substep-concept-idea-thread.40975/post-1348007){:target="_blank"}.  
It is a joke variant of [ZZ](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/ZZ_method){:target="_blank"}.

# Steps
The method follows these steps:

1. **EOLineLine**: Orient edges and solve the two edge lines consisting of FL, BL, DF and DB
2. **Left line**: Solve a triplet (corner + edge + corner) in DL
3. **Right line**: Solve another triplet, this time in DR
4. **Edge lines**: Solve the two edge lines of UF, UB, FR and BR
5. **Last 2 Lines** *(=[ZZLL](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/ZZLL){:target="_blank"})*: Solve the remaining two triplets in UL and UR

# Why?
Firstly, lines are fun.  
However, lines also suck.  
Just like EOLine.
