title: (Almost) everything is CFOP
---
If you are into cubing, you have certainly heard about the famous [CFOP method](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/CFOP_method){:target="_blank"}.

The following message will show you that almost everything is CFOP and that therefore, non-CFOP solvers do not exist.

<p id="everything_is_cfop">> raven: oh u use an offbeat method? name every non cfop solver ever<br>
RedstoneTim: there's none because we all use cfop.<br>
zb is cfop so cfce is too and in fact any LSLL variant of cfop is cfop.<br>
jayden said zz with eocross is cfop, so it's true. because zz with eocross is zz and zz with eoline is also zz, cfop = zz.<br>
petrus is just bad cfop. many new people have told me this, so it's true. you just do freefop and do zz which is also cfop and then cfop.<br>
roux is just zz because zz-ghost, so it's cfop.<br>
leor is cfop because it's just bad petrus which is just bad cfop.<br>
mehta is just bad leor so it's also cfop.<br>
corners first is just roux but without blocks so cfop.<br>
the only method that isn't cfop is hexagonal francisco<br>
