title: LEOR Method
---
The **LEOR Method** is a 3x3 method which combines aspects of [Roux](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Roux_method){:target="_blank"} and [ZZ](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/ZZ_method){:target="_blank"}, although it seems to be described best as a variant of [Petrus](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Petrus_Method){:target="_blank"}.  
It was first conceived of by Arc and Pyjam[^1], although it has its precursors in the works of Joseph Briggs and Noah Arthurs[^2].

# Steps

## Overview
1. First block/Left block (dL): A 1x2x3 block is built on the left side of the cube as in Roux.
2. EOStripe (EO()+dm): The unique step of LEOR where edges are oriented while a "stripe" (DF and DB edges along with the centers) is formed.
3. Right block/Second block (dR): The 1x2x3 block on right side is solved, generally <R, U>-gen, which is similar to EOLine blockbuilding in ZZ or exactly the same as the right block of Petrus.
4. ZBLL (U): The last layer, which has its edges already oriented, is solved using one of many strategies such as full ZBLL.

## EOStripe
As stated earlier, EOStripe is the defining feature of LEOR, but due to its uniqueness, it is often also the biggest problem for those wanting to switch, especially as resources are very scarce.  
Therefore, to aid the general understanding of EOStripe, this section compiles some information on it.

### Movecount
*The following is a table of all EOStripe states sorted by their <R, r, M, U>-gen movecount in STM.*[^3]

|Depth   |New     |Total|% of all	|
|:-------|:-------|:----|:----------|
|0       |1       |1	|0,00136%   |
|1       |3       |4	|0,00543%   |
|2       |9       |13	|0,0122%    |
|3       |63      |76	|0,0854%    |
|4       |210     |286	|0,285%     |
|5       |1110    |1396	|1,51%      |
|6       |2968    |4364	|4,03%      |
|7       |12069   |16433|16,4%      |
|8       |20026   |36459|27,2%      |
|9       |26641   |63100|36,1%      |
|10      |8730    |71830|11,8%      |
|11      |1814    |73644|2,46%      |
|12      |82      |73726|0,111%     |
|13      |2       |73728|0,00271%   |
|14      |0       |73728|0,00%      |

Average movecount: 8.37 STM


# Applications
As LEOR only has a [small userbase](#notable-users) which, as of now, contains no one who is world-class, LEOR's potential still remains unproven and as such, not much can be said about its viability, although it currently appears that it might be most effective for one-handed solving due to favoring 2-gen solving.  
Furthermore, it may also be used as a [4x4 method](#see-also) for people coming from ZZ who prefer doing EO on big cubes without the problems that EO-first steps like EOLine and EOCross pose.

# Resources
Because LEOR has much in common with other more popular methods, resources for all steps - with the notable exception of [EOStripe](#eostripe) - are generally readily found.
